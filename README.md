Parallelized ray tracer built using NVIDIA's CUDA to test certain parallelized optimizations (for full details, see final-paper.pdf). Impletation based on implementation found in [Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Graphics:_Principles_and_Practice).

1. To compile, run make

2. Usage: ray-tracer [num-triangles] [input.txt] [output.jpg]

To run the example, use the command line arguments as follows:

num-triangles = 4
input.txt = testScene.txt
output.jpg = output.jpg

The rendered image will be saved to output.jpg
